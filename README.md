# Breakout
The game breakout from scratch!

### Approach
 - I want to make a thorough, decoupled design, that can be iterated on easily.
 - There might be places where I use design principles that seem too robust for a simple game, but I would like to show my knowledge.

### Controls
 - Arrow left/right -> move platform
 - ? possible restart level (ctrl + r?)
 - esc - options / return to menu?

### preplannig
- Map editing
  - Will need to make this a config file pipeline, I am thinking the CSV format could work
  - Potential for a map editor in game
- Use OOP and Design prinicples where possible
- Int to Binary back to Int will be used in scoring
